# Current implementation and acceptance

Status: maintained
Reviewed: 2026-10-11
Evidence: [candidate.30 install](../evidence/delivery/live-install-candidate30.json),
[independent readback](../evidence/delivery/candidate30-independent-readback.json),
[user acceptance](../evidence/forever-ui/candidate30-live-acceptance.json).

## Installed checkpoint

Candidate `2.0.0-candidate.30` was installed October 10, 2026 at 20:54:04 Toronto
from tested/pushed source `dcc0fbabebe701af138b98c98633274c18875a32`.
Only Forever was replaced. Retained readback verifies 58 installed files,
2,498 unselected addon files and 306 WTF files unchanged, and 42 junctions/root
anchors preserved. Backups are recorded in the receipt. This describes the
recorded installation, not a fresh live inventory. Further installation requires
current authorization with WoW closed.

## Acceptance

On October 10 the user reported: "all fixed on ring and required item frame".
The native account ping ring's reported behavior/reopening defect and Forever's
Immersion Required Items correction are accepted in Retail. Broader combat,
account, editing and preference cases are not individually asserted.

Earlier acceptance covers reported candidate.17 face-composition/HUD defects
and Paladin/DH ground casting, as recorded in [manual cases](MANUAL-TEST-CASES.md).
These are scoped observations; later changes still require regression gates.

## Current execution boundaries

- Store schema 3; configuration revision 17.
- Native ConsolePort input recovery enabled. Full custom modes/UI takeover and
  hidden-control replacement remain suspended.
- Temporary native-family routing uses L2+R2, preserving ordinary banks.
- Ground placement is a separate active adapter.
- Automatic action restoration removed; diagnostic observers remain passive.
- Native-bound gamepad ping keys (preset R3) send on release through native
  secure machinery. Native selection is armed immediately; neutral/empty tap
  falls back, deflected/sticky early release can select. Hold artwork uses a
  cosmetic monitor and actual ConsolePort account-ring data.
- Saved Edit Mode layouts are authoritative. Capture does not save/import/select
  layouts; existing manual/Party edits remain owned by the user.
- Personal class-ring augmentation and scoped class-access repair remain distinct
  from removed action-slot restoration. Generic proposal helpers are not limited
  by every three-class presentation/repair guard.
- Reviewed sidebar/bag/micro visibility, qualified class-row suppression and
  focus-feedback cosmetics have independent activation; native power remains.
- The Targeting panel remains available in recovery. Accepted stored policy
  flags alone do not prove the corresponding dormant UI path is enabled.

[known issues](KNOWN_ISSUES.md) records open reports and gated features.

## Validation and repository work

Candidate.30 retains [67 runtime/source passes](../evidence/test-results/candidate30-runtime.json)
and [39 tooling passes](../evidence/test-results/candidate30-tooling.json).
These are historical exact-source receipts; changed inventories need current
checks. Restructure verification is retained in the
[repository receipt](../evidence/organization/2026-10-11/ai-native-restructure.json).
Offline checks do not certify Retail authority, hardware or rendering.

The October 11 restructure changes no runtime/installed state. The complete
previous chronology is preserved in the
[historical snapshot](archive/ai-native-2026-10-11/IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.pre-restructure.md).
Use the [cumulative checklist](NEXT-DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md) for later Retail tests.

Restructure qualification: [67 runtime/source passes](../evidence/test-results/ai-native-restructure-runtime-2026-10-11.json)
and [45 tooling passes](../evidence/test-results/ai-native-restructure-tooling-2026-10-11.json),
including six new documentation-checker tests. All 30 maintained page/skill files
pass navigation/structure checks; three skills pass the standard Skill Creator
validator. Current inventories include the imported provisioning scripts as
data, without executing them. Nine exact historical snapshots and seven preserved
source/reference/fallback trees are verified unchanged. These are repository
qualification results, not a new Retail test or deployment.

The subsequent October 11 [code/document reconciliation](reference/CODE-DOCUMENTATION-RECONCILIATION-2026-10-11.md)
expands actual initialization, configuration, ownership, visuals and dormant UI
contracts. It corrects stale/overbroad statements without changing product,
tooling, dependency or installed state. Historical restructure counts above
describe that earlier checkpoint; current navigation checks and preserved-source
verification are recorded in the separate
[reconciliation receipt](../evidence/organization/2026-10-11/code-documentation-reconciliation.json).
